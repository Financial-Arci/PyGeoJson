============
geojsonio.py
============

1. Clone this repo.

2. Go to the folder where geojsonio.py is
   
   2.1 create a gitauth.txt file with user and password (theres an example in the fork)

   run: python geojsonio.py yourdataset.geojson


(I've upload one more sample: Redes_Estaduais__Ponto_em_Operação__2001.geojson)

It should work. If it doesn't, let me know.
It's just a quick fix until the original project maitainer find time 
to merge the last pull request ...
